# Building a Chess Game with AI: A Cross-Disciplinary Project

Chess is often considered the drosophila of artificial intelligence - a model organism for studying intelligence. In this article, I'll walk through my implementation of a chess game with AI capabilities, highlighting aspects relevant to software engineers, data scientists, and data engineers.

## Introduction

Chess represents the perfect intersection of software engineering (complex rules implementation), data science (AI decision making), and data engineering (efficient game state representation). My goal was to create a clean, maintainable chess application with a challenging AI opponent while applying best practices from all three disciplines.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Chesselogique**: The core logic layer containing game rules, move validation, and state management
- **ChesseUI**: The presentation layer built with WPF
- **Test.Console**: A console application for testing and debugging

## For Software Engineers

### Object-Oriented Design

The chess pieces are implemented using inheritance with a base `Piece` class and derived classes for each piece type (King, Queen, Rook, etc.). This approach allows for:

1. Shared behavior through the base class
2. Specialized movement rules through polymorphism 
3. Easy addition of new piece types if needed

```csharp
public abstract class Piece
{
    public Position Position { get; set; }
    public Player Color { get; }
    
    public abstract PieceType Type { get; }
    
    public Piece(Player color)
    {
        Color = color;
    }
    
    public abstract IEnumerable<Move> GetMoves(Position position, Board board);
}
```

### Clean Separation

The game logic is completely independent of the UI, making it:
- Testable in isolation
- Reusable in different contexts (e.g., console, web, mobile)
- Easier to understand and maintain

## For Data Scientists

### Chess AI Implementation

The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, a classic approach in game AI:

1. **Search Algorithm**: Minimax explores possible future board states to find optimal moves
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes the search by eliminating branches that won't affect the final decision
3. **Evaluation Function**: Assesses board positions based on:
   - Material balance (piece values)
   - Piece mobility
   - Board control
   - King safety

### Variable Difficulty Levels

The AI's difficulty is controlled by adjusting:
- Search depth (how many moves ahead it looks)
- Evaluation function complexity
- Time constraints

This allows players to select an appropriate challenge level while demonstrating how AI parameters affect performance.

## For Data Engineers

### Efficient Data Structures

Chess requires careful consideration of data representation:

1. **Board Representation**: Using a 2D array for direct position access
2. **Move Generation**: Cached move sets to avoid recalculation
3. **Position Evaluation**: Optimized for speed in the inner loop of the AI

### Optimization Techniques

Several performance optimizations were implemented:

1. **Move Ordering**: Examining promising moves first to improve alpha-beta pruning
2. **Transposition Tables**: Caching previously evaluated positions
3. **Bitboards**: Using bitwise operations for specific calculations

## Conclusion

This chess project demonstrates how principles from software engineering, data science, and data engineering come together to create a complete application. The clean architecture, AI implementation, and performance optimizations showcase best practices from all three disciplines.

The project is open source and available at: [https://github.com/Boussyf0/Chess_Game](https://github.com/Boussyf0/Chess_Game). I welcome contributions and feedback from professionals in any of these fields.
