ðŸŽ® **Just Released: Chess Game with AI Opponent â€“ An Open Source Project**

I'm excited to share my latest project: a fully-featured chess application with an intelligent AI opponent! 

This project demonstrates the intersection of software engineering, algorithmic thinking, and practical AI application:

âœ… **For Software Engineers**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns, object-oriented design patterns, and efficient UI implementation using WPF.

âœ… **For Data Scientists**: The AI implementation showcases minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, position evaluation using piece value metrics, and strategic decision making.

âœ… **For Data Engineers**: Optimized data structures for efficient state representation and game tree exploration.

## Technical Highlights

- Complete implementation of chess rules including special moves
- Multiple AI difficulty levels for varied gameplay
- Clean, modern UI with intuitive controls
- Modular architecture that separates game logic from presentation

I'd love to connect with other professionals interested in game development, AI, or algorithmic problem-solving. The project is open source and available at: https://github.com/Boussyf0/Chess_Game
